Stochastic Techno-Economic Microgrid Model

These modules work together to simulate a microgrid's technical and economic performance under uncertainty. Through monte-carlo simulation, the results include the project net present value (NPV) and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) distributions as main outputs.
